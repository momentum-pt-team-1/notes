# Django Users and Registration

## Django Registration Redux

This library is used often to provide registration, login, and logout for users.
The documentation is good, but a little hard to follow sometimes. 
The simplest implementation is:
- [ ] install `django-registration-redux`
- [ ] add `registration` to the list of INSTALLED_APPS in `settings.py`.
- [ ] follow the instructions for ["Simple" (one-step) backend](https://django-registration-redux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simple-backend.html)

---

- [ ] Make sure you have a file in your `templates` directory called `base.html` and it has `title`, `meta` and `block` tags.
- [ ] Django Registration Redux provides these [urls](https://django-registration-redux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urls.html?highlight=urls#registration-urls) for registration actions
